# Panson

Panson is an interactive sonification framework based on sc3nb.

## Installation

You can installed the required dependencies with the following command:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You may want to install it in a virtual environment. If you are using conda:

```sh
conda create --name panson python=3.9
```

Possibly, there will be problems installing `av`, because it needs a C++ compiler.
You can install everything with:

```sh
conda install -c conda-forge av~=8.1.0
```
